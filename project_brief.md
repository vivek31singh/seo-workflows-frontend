# Project Brief: seo-workflows-frontend

## Project Type
Frontend-only Static Web Application with Interactive Elements (Marketing & Tool Directory)

## Project Goals (Golden Context)
To build a high-performance, accessible, and SEO-friendly SEO resource hub using Next.js. The primary goal is to provide a centralized directory of free SEO tools and resources that runs entirely in the browser using mock data. The application must demonstrate clean UI/UX, responsive design, and client-side interactivity without relying on external servers or APIs.

## Complexity
**Moderate**.
**Justification**: While there is no backend complexity (no databases, auth, or API integration), the project requires a sophisticated frontend architecture. The complexity arises from dynamic form generation based on JSON schemas, client-side filtering/search logic, accessible UI component implementation, and managing routing state in a Next.js App Router context. The need for a polished, marketing-grade design adds to the frontend effort.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Heroicons (SVG) or Lucide React
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useMemo, useEffect)
- **Form Handling**: Controlled components (React standard)
- **Data Source**: Local JSON files
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier
