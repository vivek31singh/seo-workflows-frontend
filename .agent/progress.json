    "Initialize the Next.js 14+ application with TypeScript, configure Tailwind CSS, set up the folder structure (/app, /components, /lib, /types, /data), and create the necessary configuration files (tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.ts, next.config.js, postcss.config.js, .eslintrc.json).",
    "Implement Phase 2: Data Layer & Types.\n1. Create the `types/index.ts` file and define the `Tool`, `Resources`, and related interfaces based on the Technical Specification.\n2. Create the `data/tools.json` file and populate it with 3-4 mock tool objects (e.g., a Keyword Density Checker, a Meta Tag Generator) adhering to the defined schema.\n3. Create the `data/resources.json` file and populate it with mock glossary terms, blog posts, and chatbot links.",
    "Implement Phase 3: Global Layout & Navigation. Create `components/layout/Header.tsx` (with Logo and DesktopNav) and `components/layout/Footer.tsx`. Then, update `app/layout.tsx` to import and render these components to establish the site's global structure.",
    "Implement the Mobile Navigation component (`components/layout/MobileMenu.tsx`).\n1. Create the `MobileMenu.tsx` component using the `use client` directive.\n2. Implement a slide-over UI (off-canvas menu) with transition animations using Tailwind CSS.\n3. Add navigation links to key sections (Home, Tools, Resources, Company).\n4. Update `components/layout/Header.tsx` to include a hamburger icon (using Lucide React) that toggles the mobile menu's visibility.\n5. Ensure the menu closes when a link is clicked or the overlay is clicked.",
    "Implement Phase 4: Core UI Components. Create the reusable component library in the `components/ui` directory. Specifically, implement `Button.tsx` (with variants like primary/secondary), `Input.tsx`, `Textarea.tsx`, and `Card.tsx` using Tailwind CSS and TypeScript interfaces.",
    "Implement Phase 5: The Homepage.\n1. Create `components/home/HeroSection.tsx`: A large marketing section with a headline, subheadline, and primary/secondary CTA buttons (using the `Button` component).\n2. Create `components/home/CategoryGrid.tsx`: A grid layout displaying the available tool categories (Data Analysis, Relevance, Technical, Authority) with icons and links to the tools page.\n3. Create `components/home/ResourceStrip.tsx`: A preview section highlighting the Resources hub (Glossary, Blog, etc.).\n4. Update `app/page.tsx` to import and compose these components within a main container.",
    "Implement Phase 6: Tools Directory Logic. This involves creating:\n1. `components/tools/ToolCard.tsx`: A component to display tool summary (name, description, category) using the `Card` primitive.\n2. `app/tools/page.tsx`: The main directory page containing a `FilterBar` (search input and category chips) and a `ToolGrid` that renders `ToolCard`s. This page must use client-side logic (`useState`, `useMemo`) to filter the imported `tools.json` data in real-time.",
    "Implement Phase 7: Dynamic Tool Detail Pages.\n1. Create `app/tools/[slug]/page.tsx` to fetch the specific tool based on the URL slug and handle \"not found\" states.\n2. Create `components/tools/ToolForm.tsx` to dynamically render input fields (Text, Textarea, Select) by mapping over the `tool.inputs` array from the data.\n3. Create `components/tools/ResultPanel.tsx` to display the mock JSON output after execution.\n4. Implement the \"Run\" logic within the form component: simulate an async operation with a loading state, then generate and display mock results."
